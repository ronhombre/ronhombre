## Notable Projects
### [KyberKotlin](https://github.com/ronhombre/KyberKotlin)
- A Post-Quantum Assymetric Encryption using Learning-With-Errors (LWE) problem over module lattices. This implementation is based on NIST FIPS 203 and is fully written in 100% Kotlin.
### [BarrettReduceKotlinExample](https://github.com/ronhombre/BarrettReduceKotlinExample)
- A Kotlin example implementation for the Barrett Reduction Algorithm.
### [MontgomeryArithmeticKotlinExample](https://github.com/ronhombre/MontgomeryArithmeticKotlinExample)
- A Kotlin example implementation for the Montgomery Arithmetic involving Montgomery Forms and Reduction.
